You are currently viewing the GitHub for my **C# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge**. 

# C# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge
This is a basic program that has four input fields. The first two fields require the user to input two integers that will be used as multiples of a range of numbers. The last two fields are what determine the range the multiples of will be ran against. For example, putting in 3 and 5 in the first two fields and putting in 1 and 100 in the last two fields. This will run the program and for any multiples of 3 and 5 from numbers 1 to 100, the program will return Fizz for 3 and Buzz for 5. If it find a number with a multiple of both 3 and 5 it will return FizzBuzz.

The program was written in C# and has a custom model.
